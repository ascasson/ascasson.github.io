      <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Please excuse this temporary space (and excessive text) while I continue building a more appropriate portfolio property. You should at least be able to see some of my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list of technologies I have worked with grows daily, but the core stack is Angular, Express, Node, and MongoDB (MEAN). Of course, the ability to work in that stack would not be very good without having extensive knowledge in classic libraries like jQuery, and an expert grasp of JavaScript ES5/ES6 in their "vanilla" forms.
      </p>
      <h2>Ramble: A Diary Application</h2>
      <p>
        Writing has been a central part of my life. Keeping a diary or journal does a lot for the mind. Finding a simple, private writing space on the web, however, made the process a little more difficult. Most platforms start public and have a private option, either as a whole or for individual posts, but there is always the risk of having entries exposed as a result of improper settings. Ramble is an opinionated platform, taking a private-always approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I led a team of 6 developers over a few weeks to build the app using the MEAN stack. Check out <a href="http://www.ramblewriting.com/" target="_blank">www.ramblewriting.com</a> to play with it. <a href="https://github.com/ascasson/ramble" target="_blank">View the frontend source code here</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ascasson/ramble-app" target="_blank">backend source code here</a>.

      <h2>Signature Case Studies by Recurrence</h2>
      <p>
        I held an intern Junior Software Developer role from April to October 2016 for <a href="http://recurrenceinc.com/" target="_blank">Recurrence, Inc.</a>, who specialize in education software. The project I worked on was Signature Case Studies, a business develpment game used in over 30 universities around the country. It also relies on the MEAN stack of technolgies, with a heavy use of HTML5 Canvas for in-game animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main task was to help implement new UI/UX features for the user views and also administrator views for handling backend data. Most of this was built using Angular and HTML5 canvas animations through the CreateJS library suite.
      </p>

        While you can't look at the code, you can view an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/06/09/recurrence-gamifies-leadership-for-college-students/">article written about the product here</a>, which shows some of the UI I helped redesign.
